## What user sees

- [ ] A Welcome screen with text, images and a button.
- [ ] A title and page numbers are at the top of the Welcome screen and a History button is at the bottom. These are also on the screen with the exercise video. The page numbers indicate there are four numbered pages after this page. The waving hand symbol is highlighted.
- [ ] The screen with the exercise video also has a timer, a Start/Done button and rating symbols. One of the page numbers is highlighted.
- [ ] The History screen shows the user’s exercise history as a list and as a bar chart. It has a title but no page numbers and no History button.
- [ ] The High Five! screen has an image, some large text and some small gray text. Like the History screen, it has no page numbers and no History button.

## What the app does 

- [ ] The History and High Five! screens are modal sheets that slide up over the Welcome or Exercise screen. Each has a button the user taps to dismiss it, either a circled “X” or a Continue button.
- [ ] On the Welcome and Exercise screens, the matching page number is white text or outline on a black background. Tapping the History button displays the History screen.
- [ ] The Welcome page Get Started button displays the next page.
- [ ] On an Exercise page, the user can tap the play button to play the video of the exercise.
- [ ] On an Exercise page, tapping the Start button starts a countdown timer, and the button label changes to Done. Ideally, the Done button is disabled until the timer reaches 0. Tapping Done adds this exercise to the user’s history for the current day.
- [ ] On an Exercise page, tapping one of the five rating symbols changes the color of that symbol and all those preceding it.
- [ ] Tapping Done on the last exercise shows the High Five! screen.
- [ ] Nice to have: Tapping a page number goes to that page. Tapping Done on an Exercise page goes to the next Exercise page. Dismissing the High Five! screen returns to the Welcome page.
